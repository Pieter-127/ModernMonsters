            Matchup.BUG -> "Bug-type Pokémon are characterized by their fast growing, as they don't take long to evolve. Bug-type Pokémon live mostly (not all of them) in forests, some of them are a little harder to find because they live atop the trees.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The majority of the Pokémon with this type are based on real-life invertebrates (spiders, scorpions, butterflies, moths, etc.).\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "From Generation V on, it is known that Bug-type Pokémon are preferred by artists, mostly because they have beautiful colors and have a stoic and cheerful character. It can be said that Bug-type Pokémon represent the beauty of nature. Many of their evolutionary lines are similar to the life cycles of insects like that of beetles and butterflies; i.e. the first stage like larvae, second like pupae, then its final evolution into its mature, adult form.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The known famous Bug-type Trainers are: Bugsy, the second Gym Leader of Azalea Town in Johto; Aaron, the first member of the Elite Four of the Pokémon League (Sinnoh); Burgh, the third Gym Leader of Castelia City in Unova; Viola, the first Gym Leader of Santalune City in Kalos; and Katy, the first Gym Leader of Cortondo Gym in Paldea. "
            Matchup.DARK -> "The Dark type was added in Generation II to counteract the Psychic type's dominance in Generation I, by being completely immune to it and able to hit Psychic types super-effectively. It was also given to make the Fighting type and Bug type more dominant due to their downfall to Psychic types in Generation I. Since Generation VI, it is weak to Fairy types.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The Dark type is represented from traits that are considered feral and untameable, specifically that born from adverse and intense complex social conditions; to that of traits that evoke a negative leaning nature - from having a nocturnal day cycle, exhibitions of unusually cruel, crafty, and clever intelligence, belligerent aggressiveness, the sentient awareness and choice to harm and/or inflict ill will, and to that of the negative end of nature and reality; such as the shadows, declination, \"the survival of the fittest\", destruction, comings of darker times; and to the unknown but potentially dangerous aspects of the mysterious and enigmatic. It should be further noted that the type of Dark does not automatically associate with the concept of evil, as both evidence exists of cruelty capable of Pokémon not just of the type (Ekans, Fearow) and that it is the trainer that influences majorly how a Pokémon matures and acts.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Many Dark types are rather just born with features that define them as a type, as they understand of the powers that come with it, such as Absol and Sableye, and/or are defined so by the perspective of humans with necessary purpose in the environment and their species but whose actions and traits are at most taboo and are discouraged in human society.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Before Generation IV, every damage-inflicting Dark-type moves were special moves. All pre-existing Dark attacks that dealt damage changed to become physical in Generation IV, meaning that any Dark special attacks would be introduced from Generation IV onward. Non-damaging Dark moves work to disrupt the opponent in unique ways or raise user stats.\n" +

                    "The known famous Dark-type Trainers are: Karen, the fourth member of the Elite Four of the Johto Pokémon League; Sidney, the first member of the Elite Four of the Pokémon League (Hoenn); Grimsley, a member of the Elite Four of the Pokémon League (Unova); Nanu, an island Kahuna in Alola; Piers, the seventh Gym Leader of Galar; Marnie, Piers' sister and successor; and Giacomo, the boss of Team Star's Segin Squad. "
            Matchup.DRAGON -> "The Dragon-type is often considered an ancestral type as many Legendary Dragon-type Pokémon are revered as deities. Other Dragon-type Pokémon are frequently hard to catch and train. They also evolve late and are relatively rare. An interesting fact is that the stats of many Dragon-type Pokémon surpass the stats of other types of Pokémon.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Most Pokémon with the Dragon-type are usually reptilian in appearance, with a few exceptions being Charizard (who is Fire/Flying by default, but can become part Dragon-type if exposed to a Charizardite X Mega Stone). Other Dragon-type Pokémon lack draconic traits, such as Vibrava (who closely resembles an insect more than a dragon), Dragalge (whose overall design is based on the leafy seadragon, a type of fish), Alolan Exeggutor (with traits more close to a plant, more specifically a palm tree).\n" +

"
            Matchup.ELECTRIC -> "The Electric type is a type of Pokémon that have electricity-oriented powers. They possess electro-kinetic abilities, being able to control, store, or even produce electricity.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Electric-type Pokémon have varied habitats, from forests and prairies to cities and power plants. Electric-type Pokémon are usually fast, and many of their attacks may paralyze the target. Some Electric-type Pokémon also resemble artificial objects used by humans which relate to electricity (the Magnemite and Voltorb evolution lines and Rotom).\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Some of the Electric-type Pokémon Trainers are Lt. Surge, the third Gym Leader of Kanto; Wattson, the third Gym Leader of Hoenn; Volkner, the last Sinnoh Gym Leader; Elesa the fourth Gym Leader of Unova; Clemont, the fifth Gym Leader of Kalos; Sophocles, a Trial Captain of Ula'ula Island, Alola; and Iono of Paldea. "
            Matchup.FAIRY -> "The Fairy type was introduced in Generation VI to balance the Dragon and Dark types. It is super-effective against both types and also resisted most types that were introduced in the past Generation (mostly Bug, Fighting, and Dark types). Another reason why the Fairy type was introduced was to give offensive advantages to the Steel and Poison types. Prior to Generation VI, the Dark/Ghost-type Sableye and Spiritomb had no weaknesses, so the Fairy type was added to give them a weakness.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Fairy-type Pokémon are generally considered \"cute\" and \"elegant\" and tend to be at least partially pink in color and feminine in appearance overall (Pokémon such as Igglybuff and Swirlix have these traits). However, Fairy types can be incredibly powerful. Fairy-types also have some magical appeal to them. As opposed to Psychic-type Pokémon, Fairy-type Pokémon have powers related to magic and the supernatural as opposed to mental power. Fairy types are also known for their powers of purity and rejuvenation (Pokémon such as Gardevoir, Xerneas, and Galarian Weezing are shown to have special powers that can purify objects). Other Fairy types with non-psychic powers are still given the Fairy type for certain magical abilities (Jigglypuff can put people to sleep by singing and the Guardian Deities are seen as gods). They could also be based on other types of powers, have mysterious origins, or be based on folktale creatures (Pokémon such as Clefairy, which come from the moon, and Diancie, which is a mutated form of Carbink). Many Fairy types are also known for their almost sweet nature, metaphorically and literally (for example, Pokémon like Spritzee, Slurpuff & Flabébé are based on sweet-smelling things like perfume, candy, and flowers respectively). However, others are more dangerous and tricky (such as Mawile and its huge jaws; Impidimp, which feeds off emotions of frustrated people; or Shiinotic, who lures prey with lights), which are more befitting of fairies seen in folklore as opposed to popular culture.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The known famous Fairy-type Pokémon Trainers are Valerie, the sixth Gym Leader of the Kalos region; Mina, the Fairy-type Trial Captain of the Alola region; Opal, the fifth Gym Leader of the Galar region; Bede, Opal's successor (he was previously Psychic-type trainer); Ortega, the boss of Team Star's Ruchbah Squad; and Lacey, a member of BB League Elite Four. "
            Matchup.FIGHTING -> "Pokémon of this type are specialists in melee attacks, such as punches and kicks. It could be said that they're the opposite to Psychic-type Pokémon because while Pokémon of that type depend primarily on special attacks, Pokémon of the Fighting type depend mostly on physical attacks. In particular, every Fighting-type attack introduced before Generation IV remained a physical attack, with special Fighting attacks only being introduced from Generation IV onwards.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Most Fighting-type Pokémon have a human-like body shape because they represent practitioners of various martial arts, which tend to be real-world humans. Some Fighting-type Pokémon are represented by looking like fighters (Machamp looks like a bodybuilder and Crabrawler looks like a French-wrestler) while other are represented by being based on a certain type of fighting style (Hitmontop is based on capoeira fighting and Gallade is based on sword-fighting). A considerable number of Fighting-type Pokémon are predominantly or exclusively male. They can also be represented by simply just having incredible strength (such Pokémon such as Bewear, Pangoro, Crabominable, Conkeldurr and others have this).\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Fighting-type Pokémon have varied ways to evolve as this represents a fighter going on a journey to get stronger and find out who he/she is supposed to be.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Every generation has introduced at least one Fighting-type specialist: Bruno, the second member of the Kanto and Johto Elite Four; Chuck, the fifth Gym Leader of the Johto region; Brawly, the second Hoenn Gym Leader; Maylene, the third Gym Leader of Sinnoh; Marshal, a member of the Unova Elite Four; Korrina, the third Gym Leader of the Kalos region; Hala, the Melemele Island Kahuna of the Alola region, Bea, the fourth Gym Leader of Galar in Pokémon Sword, and Eri the boss of Team Star's Caph Squad in Paldea. "
            Matchup.FIRE -> "Fire-type moves are based on attacks of fire itself, and most of them can leave the status Burn. Fire types are also immune to being Burned, regardless of the type of move used that would have inflicted a Burn.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Fire Pokémon have notably fewer species compared to the other Starter types, due to a lack of natural phenomena that can be described as fire - the Slugma line, Numel line, Magmar line, Torkoal, Volcarona and Volcanion are the closest representation. Some Fire-type species are based on land animals known for their predatory instincts, such as Pyroar, Arcanine and Heatmor. The Vulpix and Fennekin lines are both based on Japanese folklore linking species of fox with fire, while curiously, most generations of Fire-type starter, as well as the Ponyta, Houndour and Pansear lines, are all based on animals from the Chinese zodiac. However, there are a few Fire-type Pokémon that are based on inanimate objects, such as Rotom's Heat form and the Litwick line.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Famous Fire-type Pokémon Trainers include Blaine, the seventh Kanto Gym Leader; Flannery, the fourth Hoenn Gym Leader; Flint, the third member of the Sinnoh Pokémon League; Chili, one of the first three Gym Leaders of Striaton City in Unova; Malva, a member of the Kalos Pokémon League; Kiawe, an Akala Island Trial Captain in Alola; Kabu, the third Gym Leader in Galar; Mela the boss of Team Star's Fire crew, the Schedar Squad; and Crispin, a member of BB League Elite Four. "
            Matchup.FLYING -> "Pokémon of this type can fly, many of them live at high altitudes, even. Most of them are based on birds and insects. Their power is mostly related with aerial and wind-related moves. Most of them have wings, but there are also some of them that just float without wings, like Rayquaza and Gyarados.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Flying has been paired with every other Pokémon type to create a species; the introduction of Fighting/Flying Hawlucha completed all possible pairings. Until Generation V no species was ever a pure Flying type; purely Flying typing could only be obtained in battle by Porygon, Kecleon and Arceus, which all had signature moves or Abilities to do so.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Famous Flying-type Pokémon Trainers include Falkner, the first Gym Leader of the Johto region; Winona, the sixth Gym Leader of Hoenn; Skyla, the sixth Unova Gym Leader; Kahili, a member of the Alola Elite Four; and Larry, a member of Paldea Elite Four. "
            Matchup.GHOST -> "The Ghost type is notable for having few Pokémon (many of whom have low HP) and moves. In battles, the Ghost-type is useful because it's the only type that has two immunities: Normal and Fighting, both of which are common move types. From Generation VI onwards, Ghost-types are also immune to moves and abilities that prevent escaping, like Block and Shadow Tag.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Pokémon of this type are usually connected to fear, the dark and the afterlife. They usually live in abandoned houses, cemeteries, funeral places and uninhabited dark places such as caves. Also, Ghost-type Pokémon tend to be extremely naughty, pranking humans just to see their faces and reactions. Curiously, the more scared a human is, the more power the Ghost Pokémon will have to prank with it. At worst, some Ghost-type Pokémon may have relatively murderous behaviors, such as Jellicent preying on ships and their crews or the Litwick evolutionary family draining the life energy from people that are lost.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Famous Ghost-type Pokémon Trainers include Agatha, third member of the Kanto Elite Four; Morty, the fourth Gym Leader of Johto; Phoebe, second member of the Hoenn Elite Four; Fantina, the fifth Gym Leader in the Sinnoh region; Shauntal, a member of the Unova Elite Four; Acerola, a Trial Captain of Ula'ula Island, Alola as well as its third Elite Four member; Allister, the fourth Gym Leader of Galar in Pokémon Shield; and Ryme, the Gym Leader of Montenevera in Paldea. "
            Matchup.GRASS -> "Many Grass types are based on plants and fungi, not necessarily grass (Pokémon such as Cacturne, which is a cactus, and Foongus, which is a mushroom). Many Grass-type Pokémon also belong to the Plant Egg Group. Several Grass types are paired with the Poison type (Pokémon such as Oddish, Venusaur and Bellsprout), reflecting the toxicity of several plants towards mainly humans. Most Grass-types are also simply animals with plant life attached to them (Pokémon such as Bulbasaur, Paras, Sceptile, Gogoat and Tropius). Some Grass-types are also based on mythical creatures (Pokémon such as Shiftry, which is based on a Tengu, and Tangela, which is based on Medusa).\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Most Grass-types can learn \"seed\", \"spore\" or \"powder\" moves that inflict status (usually Poison, Paralysis or Sleep), including a unique type of status caused by Leech Seed; thus, many Grass-types employ a passive style of play during battle. In terms of direct attacks, Grass-types drain HP from opponents with moves like Giga Drain, or attack with leaves, vines, petals, wood or sunlight.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Famous Grass-type Pokémon Trainers include Erika, fourth Gym Leader of the Kanto region; Gardenia, the second Gym Leader of Sinnoh; Cilan, one of the three Striaton Gym Leaders in Unova; Ramos, the fourth Gym Leader of the Kalos region; Mallow, an Akala Island Trial Captain in Alola; and Milo, first Gym Leader of Galar. "
            Matchup.GROUND -> "Ground-type Pokémon have powers and abilities related to control of ground and earth. Ground-type Pokémon are afraid of water, like Rock-type Pokémon, unless they are Water type. Many Ground Pokémon are also partially Rock type.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "These Pokémon are normally found in caves or rocky terrains, with the exceptions of some dual typed Pokémon. One bad thing about them is that they can't normally come off the ground, such as Diglett and Dugtrio, even though they are pretty good combatants when they are below the Earth's surface. They have powerful moves such as Earthquake and Fissure.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Famous Ground-type Pokémon Trainers include Giovanni, the last Gym Leader of the Kanto region (also leader of Team Rocket); Bertha, a member of the Sinnoh Elite Four; Clay, the fifth Gym Leader in Unova; Hapu, an island Kahuna in Alola; and Rika, a member of the Paldea Elite Four. "
            Matchup.ICE -> "Ice-type Pokémon stand out for being able to endure very low temperatures, as well as adapting to freezing weathers. They control ice at will. Their habitats go from the top of mountains, frozen caves and caverns or even the poles.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Many Ice-type moves have chances of freezing the target, which prevents them from attacking until they thaw out.\n" +

"
            Matchup.NORMAL -> "More moves are Normal type than any other type; however, many of these moves are status moves that don't inflict any damage. Prior to Generation IV, all Normal-type moves that dealt damage were physical attacks; today, the majority of Normal attacks remain physical, with only a few special-attacking Normal moves introduced plus a handful of previous attacks being changed to special-attacking. Normal moves are widely distributed among the majority of species of Pokémon, with several capable of being learned by every species that can learn TMs and HMs, or Move Tutor moves. Some low-powered moves like Tackle and Scratch stand out for being the first damage-inflicting move that various species learn by level-up.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Among species, Normal-type Pokémon tend to be based on a variety of different real-world animals. Normal typically did not pair with other types except Flying, in order to portray standard species of birds. As the generations progressed, more Normal types were introduced that represented other types as well. In every generation, one would encounter a purely Normal-type species in the wild in the first route that they encounter wild Pokémon in; that particular species would evolve into its final form at or before level 20.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The Normal type has been specifically engineered to lack any offensive or defensive advantage: offensively it hits no types super-effectively but two types resist it and one is immune to it, while defensively it resists no types (but is immune to one), while one type hits it super-effectively. Defensive Normal-type Pokémon would typically have high defensive stats while offensive Normal types would typically learn a large variety of moves.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Normal is also used to represent some species, and even moves, that change type - notable examples include Castform, Kecleon and Arceus, who can all change type through their abilities. Conversion and Conversion 2 both change the user's type but are learned only by Porygon's evolutionary line. Hidden Power and Natural Gift are Normal-type moves by classification but can be any other type depending on the specific factors - Hidden Power can never be Normal type in practice, while only one kind of Berry grants Natural Gift a Normal type.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Famous Normal-type Pokémon Trainers include Whitney, the third Gym Leader of the Johto region; Norman, the fifth Gym Leader of Hoenn; Lenora, the second Gym Leader of Unova; Cheren, who replaces Lenora as Gym Leader in Pokémon Black 2 and White 2; and Ilima, the Trial Captain of Melemele Island, Alola. "
            Matchup.POISON -> "These Pokémon have a natural toxic quality; some directly represent real-world species known for their venom, such as snakes, and some even represent pollution itself. They normally live in caves, marshes or similar places.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Most Poison-type Pokémon are based on poisonous or venomous animals (Pokémon such as Seviper, which is a snake, Drapion, which is a scorpion, and Scolipede, which is a centipede). Some of them are also based on poisonous plants or fungi (Pokémon such as Foongus, which is a mushroom, and Oddish, which is a mandrake root). Most dual Poison-type Pokémon have Bug type or Grass type as their other type. This reflects how, in real life, many insects and plants are poisonous or venomous. A very curious fact about Poison-type Pokémon is that some of them resemble ninjas. For example, Koffing is like a smoke ball, Crobat has a ninja's speed and secrecy and Toxicroak has paws that make it resemble a ninja. Some Poison types also resemble types of pollution. For instance, Garbodor represents trash pollution, Weezing represents air pollution and Muk represents liquid pollution. Strangely, not all Poison types are based on poisonous or venomous things (Stunky, which is based on a skunk, and Skrelp, which is based on a leafy sea dragon, are both real-life animals that are not poisonous or venomous).\n" +

            Matchup.PSYCHIC -> "The Psychic type is fairly common, and is very common among Legendary Pokémon. Psychic-type Pokémon tend to be very intelligent. It's also interesting to note that, many Psychic-type Pokémon are based/related to real scientific or mythological discoveries such as Deoxys and Alakazam which are based on DNA and psychokinesis respectively. Many Psychic-type Pokémon also came from, are associated with, or have some connection to outer space (such as Starmie, Elgyem, Solgaleo, Lunala, and Gothitelle).\n" +

            Matchup.ROCK -> "Rock-type Pokémon stand out for their great defense to physical attacks; however, this type is tied with the Grass type as having the most weaknesses, with five, and Pokémon of this type are not very fast. Also, some Rock-type moves don't have great accuracy.\n" +

                    "All Fossil Pokémon before Gen VIII are of this type. Their fossils preserve enough material genetic to be worked with to bring them back to life, but it can be known, that the Rock type was very abundant. They also have unique combinations to Pokémon of the present.\n" +

            Matchup.STEEL -> "It was introduced in Generation II along with the Dark type to balance the Psychic type and Normal type, as both types were great offensively, but the Steel type was made for Pokémon defensively. It was also made for its many resistances as pure Steel types had 10 resistances and Electric/Steel types had 11 resistances along with a Poison-type immunity for both matchups.\n" +
